## CAL - an example application in JavaScript

+ `version_one` - just the lexical analysis phase
+ `version_two` - add the parsing phase
+ `version_three` - add the execution phase

In some senses this is *idiomatic* JavaScript as I've "borrowed" the coding style from popular
open source projects which have their repositories on `GitHub`.
In other ways this is a very poor example of the prototype/functional approach to programming,
leveraging the worse of imperative/procedural coding styles.
Make of this what you will!
