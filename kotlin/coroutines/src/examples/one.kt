//Calling Thread.run() for a Thread isnâ€™t do anything other than like a normal run on the same thread
//(i.e. main thread in this case). The code get run synchronously in a sequential manner.
//(i.e. code run per the order of the line)

fun main() {
    Thread {
        println("-Thread--- start : ")
        Thread.sleep(1000)
